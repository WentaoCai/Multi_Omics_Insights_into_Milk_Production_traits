This analysis protocol can used to:
1. Proceed sequencing data from RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, lncRNA identification, RNA editing, DNA methylation and ChIP-seq data.
2. Variance componet analysis using multi-omics data and pemutation test based population data with both genotype and phenotype
3. Genomic prediction using GBLUP, MultiBLUP, BayesR, BayesRC
The data used to generate the figures and the mammary-associated functional classes have been uploaded and published on FigShare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27991175.v1).
