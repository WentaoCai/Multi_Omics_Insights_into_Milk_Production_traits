# Protocols for Gaining Insights into Complex Traits Through Multi-Omics Data
## Introduction
This analysis protocol can be utilized for:

Sequencing Data Processing: This includes RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, lncRNA identification, RNA editing, DNA methylation, and ChIP-seq data.

Variance Component Analysis: Conduct variance component analyses using multi-omics data and permutation tests based on population data, incorporating both genotype and phenotype information.

Genomic Prediction: Apply genomic prediction methods such as GBLUP, MultiBLUP, BayesR, and BayesRC.

The data used to generate the figures, as well as the mammary-associated functional classes, have been uploaded and published on FigShare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27991175.v1).
